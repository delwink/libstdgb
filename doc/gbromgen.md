gbromgen
========

gbromgen is an auxiliary post-processing tool for libstdgb meant to make it
easier to organize a Game Boy ROM image. It takes input from a simple
JSON-encoded specification and outputs a runnable binary image created by
altering the output of SDCC's `makebin` program.

It requires SDCC (for `makebin`) and Python 3 to run.

Usage
-----

    $ gbromgen [options] spec

`spec` is the specification file. Use the option `-h` or `--help` for
information about the command line arguments.

Specification File
------------------

The spec file is encoded as a JSON object. All fields of this object are
optional except for `hex`, which is the code for your program (in `ihx`
format).

### Basic configuration

A simple spec file might resemble the following:

``` json
{
    "name": "HELLO",
    "hex": "hello.ihx",
    "output": "hello.gb"
}
```

The `name` field is a short name to be stored on the ROM. Some programs use it
to store the program's version information as well.

The `hex` field is a file path relative to the location of the spec file which
serves as the input for processing. This file will be passed to SDCC's
`makebin` to be converted to binary before `gbromgen` processes it
further. This hex file is usually generated by `sdcc` after finishing
compilation.

The `output` field is a file path relative to the location of the spec file
where the final executable ROM file will be placed.
